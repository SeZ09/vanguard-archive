# vanguard-archive
Vanguard Archive is a portable, single-file game collection/backlog manager that runs entirely in your browser. It lets you organize your library with custom statuses (like "Backlog" or "Completed"), track release years and genres, and generate visual stats about your gaming habits, all without needing an internet connection or a dedicated app.
